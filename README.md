# Car Dheko - Used Car Price Predictor App ðŸš—

## Overview

**Car Dheko** is an interactive web application built with **Streamlit** that predicts the price of a used car based on user-provided features such as car make, model, kilometers driven, engine capacity, and more. The app uses a machine learning model trained with a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict the car price in real time.

## Features

### 1. **Car Price Prediction**
   - The app predicts the price of a used car based on multiple input features such as make, model, kilometers driven, engine capacity, fuel type, and more.

### 2. **Interactive Input Fields**
   - The app provides dynamic dropdowns for selecting the car's make, city, fuel type, and transmission type.
   - Numerical input fields for entering car attributes like kilometers driven, engine size, mileage, etc.

### 3. **Real-Time Predictions**
   - The app uses a pre-trained **Random Forest Regression Model** to predict car prices instantly based on user inputs.

### 4. **Error Handling & Input Validation**
   - The app checks for missing or invalid inputs and provides clear error messages to guide users in correcting any mistakes.

### 5. **Customizable Background**
   - The app includes a visually appealing car-themed background.

### 6. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Bright, bold text with an intuitive layout to enhance user interaction and overall experience.

## Example Use Case

**Scenario**:  
A customer wishes to sell a **Hyundai** car with the following details:
- **Kilometers Driven**: 40,000 km
- **Engine Capacity**: 1600 cc
- **Car Age**: 5 years
- **Fuel Type**: Diesel
- **Transmission**: Manual
- **Mileage**: 19 kmpl
- **Max Power**: 115 bhp
- **Location**: Chennai
- **Previous Owners**: 1

**Steps**:
1. The customer inputs these details into the app.
2. Clicking the "Predict Price" button, the app provides an estimated price (e.g., â‚¹7.65 Lakhs).
3. The customer uses this predicted price to set a competitive selling price.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- The necessary Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas pickle pillow
    ```

### Launching the Application

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-dheko.git
    cd car-dheko
    ```

2. Ensure that the **model file** (`rf_regression_model.pkl`), **background image**, and all necessary files are in the correct directory.

3. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Handling Errors

- **Input Validation**: If there are missing or incorrect inputs (e.g., invalid car name or negative values), the app will display appropriate error messages.
    - Example: "Kilometers Driven must be greater than 0."
    - Example: "Engine(cc) must be greater than or equal to 500."

- **Model Loading Errors**: If the machine learning model fails to load, an error message will notify the user.
    - Example: "Model file not found. Please ensure it exists at the specified location."

- **Prediction Errors**: If something goes wrong during the prediction process, the app will display an error message.
    - Example: "Prediction failed. Please try again."
